# Anagrams Game!

The Anagrams Game is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal in Heroku.

Users can try to solve five anagrams set at easy, medium or hard level of difficulty. After completing the game, users will see if they have achieved a place on the leaderboard and have an option to view the leaderboard before playing again or exiting.

[Here is the live version of the project](https://project-three-anagrams-e926f3ae0dcd.herokuapp.com/)

## How to play

This is the text the user will read if they select 'rules' as the first option in the game:

- You will be given five randomly generated words in the English language (with American spelling).
- The only problem is the letters have been jumbled up!
- You will need to try and work out what the word is.
- You have twenty seconds to solve each anagram.
- The quicker you solve the anagram the more points you will receive.
- For example, if you solve it with 12 seconds remaining you will score 12 points.
- If you score enough points your name will appear on the leaderboard.
